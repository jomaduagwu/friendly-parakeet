# Password Generator Starter Code


## Description

The purpose of this project is to modify and add functionality to a starter code for a random password generator application. When the user needs a new secure password, the user clicks on the 'generate password' button and answers a series of prompts for the desired password criteria. Once all prompts have been answered, a new secure password is generated and displayed on the page.
